# Goal of game: Go through labyrinth with 5 rooms and try to pick up many items as possible.
# Each item will have a rarity, each rarity will correspond to a number of points. There are
# traps and chests along the way to either improve chance of picking up good item or dying
# before the finish line. You can fuse 2 items to get one with higher rarity and get more points.
# Character will have 3 lives each trap will take off 1 life. Will allow player to fuse 2 items 
# with the same rarity. If you get 3 legendaries, automatically end the run you have won.
# Chests will only have epic or legendary items

# Define constants for the screen width and height

SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600

# TODO: Put all of these functions into new class called Game
